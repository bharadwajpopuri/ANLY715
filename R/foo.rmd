# Measure the arm swing for patients in the outlier table
```

```{r objective5}
# Using the "Quantification of Arm Swing during Walking in Healthy Adults and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Patients- Wearable Sensor-Based Algorithm Development and Validation" paper to establish a frame of reference for arm swing, see if you can extrapolate the asymmetry and irregularity for imed up and Go (TUG), Walking, Arm Swing(Frequency and Amplitude) and Axial Rotation
